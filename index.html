      CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a language used alongside HTML and XML
      to style and format web documents. It defines how HTML elements should
      appear on a webpage, controlling aspects like layout, colors, fonts, and
      spacing. Selectors in CSS target specific HTML elements, allowing
      developers to apply styling rules selectively. These selectors can target
      elements by tag name, class, ID, attributes, or their relationships in the
      document structure. Within selectors, developers use declarations to
      define styling properties such as color, font size, margin, padding, and
      more. The cascade and inheritance mechanisms in CSS help manage
      conflicting styles and propagate styles across elements. Styles can
      cascade from external style sheets to internal styles and inline styles.
      Inheritance allows child elements to inherit certain styles from their
      parent elements unless explicitly overridden. CSS includes the box model
      concept, treating each HTML element as a rectangular box with properties
      like width, height, padding, border, and margin. This model governs how
      elements are sized and positioned on the webpage. For responsive design,
      CSS utilizes media queries to apply different styles based on device
      characteristics like screen size, enabling developers to create websites
      that adapt to various devices seamlessly. Advanced layout options like
      Flexbox and Grid layout systems offer powerful tools for creating flexible
      and complex layouts. Flexbox aligns and distributes space among elements
      within a container, while Grid layout allows for precise grid-based
      arrangements of content. CSS also provides features for animations and
      transitions, allowing developers to add dynamic effects to elements
      without relying on external libraries or JavaScript. Keyframes animations
      define custom animation sequences, while transitions enable smooth
      property changes over time, enhancing user experience and interactivity on
      webpages. (Copied).
